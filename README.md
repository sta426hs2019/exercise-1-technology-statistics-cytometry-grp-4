## Cytometry
### **Summary**

* Cytometry is the field of measuring characteristics of cells. The area humbly began by manually counting cells through a microscope, but has since expanded massively.

* Modern Cytometry can measure complex characteristics like cell morphology or gather detailed information like the presence of specific surface elements. It also reached a high level of automation.

* An example of a prominent technology within the field is Flow Cytometry. These instrument suspend the cells of interest within a flowing medium to isolate them and then shine a laser upon each one by one. A wealth of information can be gained from the resulting light scattering thanks to a vast library of dyes. Another example is mass cytometry, in which isotopes of diverse atomic weights are separated with efficiency and Ab-seq, which finds epitopes with the aid of specific antibodies. The labeling of these antibodies is performed with sequence tags via microfluidic barcoding and DNA sequencing.
